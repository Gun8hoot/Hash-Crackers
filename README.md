# Hash-Crackers
---
- **Hash-Crackers** is a kind of a toolbox to crack and encode MD5 hashing algorithm
- Cracking can take a lot of time (With my potato computer cracking the word "root" took 30 seconds but "print" took 28 minutes)
- The script is not designed to be used in real-life situations. I created this script to challenge myself and learn more about python scripting and brute force attack.
- This script should not be used for illegal purpose.

## How to use ?
#### Linux
---
- Download the repo from github
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gun8hoot/Hash-Crackers.git
```
- Go to the "hash-cracker" folder
```bash
cd ./Hash_Cracker
```
- Launch the main.py file
```bash
python3 ./main.py
#Or
chmod u+x ./main.py
./main.py
```
- Select the module you want use by typing:
1. for dictionary brute force
2. for simple brute force attack
3. to encode a word to MD5 hash
4. to leave the script
---
#### Windows
- Download the repo from github
```batch
git clone https://github.com/Gun8hoot/Hash-Crackers.git
```
- Go to the "hash-cracker" folder
```bash
cd ./Hash_Cracker
```
- Launch the main.py file
```bash
py -3 ./main.py
```
- Select the module you want use by typing: 
1. for dictionary brute force
2. for simple brute force attack
3. to encode a word to MD5 hash
4. to leave the script
